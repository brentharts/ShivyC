"""Compilation targets (back-end architectures).

The IL produced by il_gen is architecture-neutral; everything below it -- the
register file, the calling convention, instruction selection, and the assembler
syntax -- is target-specific. This package is the seam: a `Target` object owns
those facts so the same front end can emit x86-64 today and aarch64 / riscv64
later, selected by `--target`.

Stage 1 introduces the seam and moves the smallest, most self-contained fact --
the assembler-syntax directives that wrap the program -- behind it, leaving
behavior byte-identical on x86-64. Later stages move the register file, calling
convention, and instruction selection here too.

Self-host note: the self-hosted compiler cannot read a class attribute through
the type, so every target fact is an *instance* attribute set in __init__, and
callers always work with a target *instance* (via get_target), never the class.
