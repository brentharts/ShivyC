"""Loop register-promotion for ``_Nbit`` packed globals (-fsimd-pack-globals).

A packed global is normally read by decompressing it out of ``xmm15`` (a
``movq``/shift/mask) and written by recompressing into ``xmm15`` plus its memory
mirror -- on *every* access. In a loop that hammers a few packed globals, that
per-access cost repeats every iteration.

This pass hoists that cost out of the loop. For a loop that reads/writes a small
set of packed globals and is safe to transform, it decompresses each global into
a fresh local *once before* the loop, rewrites the loop body to use that local
(an ordinary value the register allocator keeps in a GP register), and
recompresses back *once after* the loop. The decompress/recompress are ordinary
``Set`` commands, so they reuse the existing packed read/write lowering; only
their *count* drops from once-per-iteration to once-per-loop.

Safety. The transform is applied to a natural loop only when, within it: there
is no function call (a callee could observe the global through its memory
mirror, which is stale while the live value sits in a register) and no
``return``; every branch stays inside the loop or exits to the loop's single
merge label (so the recompress placed there runs on every exit, including
``break``); no outside branch jumps into the loop interior (so the decompress
always dominates the uses); and the global's address is never taken anywhere in
the function (no aliasing). A global whose occurrences cannot all be rewritten
is left untouched.
