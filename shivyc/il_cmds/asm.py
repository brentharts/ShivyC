"""IL command for a narrow, Minikraft-driven subset of GCC inline assembly.

This is deliberately NOT a general extended-asm implementation. It supports
exactly the vocabulary the Minikraft unikernel uses:

* bare side-effect-only templates (``mfence``, ``hlt``, ``sti``, the empty
  compiler barrier, ``lock; addl ...``), and
* operand templates with the constraints ``a``/``=a`` (accumulator, sized to
  the operand), ``Nd``/``d`` (treated as ``rdx``), and ``m`` (a memory operand,
  realized as the address held in ``rcx``).

Operands are numbered output-first to match GCC. Templates are emitted verbatim
inside an ``.att_syntax``/``.intel_syntax`` toggle, since Minikraft's templates
are written in AT&T syntax while ShivyC's body is Intel syntax. The ``memory``
and ``cc`` clobbers are no-ops here because ShivyC does not reorder across the
command.
