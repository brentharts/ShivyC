"""IL-level peephole optimizations, run per function just before register
allocation and code generation.

These are basic, target-independent simplifications that the -O0 code generator
otherwise leaves on the table, narrowing the gap with an optimizing compiler:

  * compare-and-branch fusion -- a comparison that feeds directly into a
    conditional jump becomes a single `cmp; jcc`, instead of materializing a
    0/1 boolean and then testing it (saves ~4 instructions per loop/if test).
  * arithmetic identities -- `x * 1`, `x + 0`, `x - 0` become a plain copy and
    `x * 0` becomes a load of 0 (these arise from address arithmetic, macro
    expansion, and generic code).

Each pass takes and returns the command list for a single function.
